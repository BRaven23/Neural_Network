Neural Network for Tumor Detection

This repository contains a neural network model designed for the classification of tumors. The project follows a comprehensive machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training and evaluation.

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a robust classification model that can accurately distinguish between malignant and benign tumors based on a given dataset. A neural network was chosen for its ability to learn complex patterns and relationships within the data.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handles data cleaning, missing value imputation, and feature scaling to prepare the dataset for the neural network.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes visualizations and statistical summaries to provide insights into the dataset and guide feature engineering.
Neural Network Architecture: Implements a simple yet effective feedforward neural network using the PyTorch library.
Model Training and Evaluation: Trains the model using an appropriate loss function and optimizer, and evaluates its performance on a test set using key metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For data splitting and performance metrics.
PyTorch: The deep learning framework used to build and train the neural networK
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: The development environment for the project.
